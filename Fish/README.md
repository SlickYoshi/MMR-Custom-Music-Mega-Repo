# Feesh's MM Music
MP3 files to listen to and ZSEQ files to put into Majora's Mask Randomizer!

- About - 
In the new version of the Majora's Mask Randomizer, you can customize what random music can play by controlling what files are in the music folder of the randomizer. I write/arrange music, and have learned how to make it into MM's format, so mine can be in-game too! This essentially is my growing collection of arrangements for MM specifically that can be used in rando.

- MP3 Files - 
MP3 Files in terms of this repository are previews on what the songs will sound like in-game. They're not COMPLETELY accurate but are pretty dang close! These are just for your listening pleasure!

- ZSEQ/MMRS Files - 
These are put into the music folder of MMR and may/may not be included in a generated seed. The less music in the folder, the higher chance.

Enjoy!
