# MMR-Custom-Music-Mega-Repo
A massive thread for downloading music from all Majora's Mask Rrandomizer music creators.

Songs are ordered by the people who created them. If you'd like to preview their content, look in the respective preview folders, located inside each of the individeal repos. In order to use the songs in the randomizer, just simply download the song you want, navigate to your Majora's Mask Randomizer folder, open up the "Resources" folder, and place the music inside of the "music" subfolder. That's it! The songs are automaticcaly added to the list of songs the randomizer can pick from.  If you have problems with any of the songs, or would like to help with the creation of new songs, don't be afraid to ask in the randomizer discord: https://discord.gg/KFpmJk6
